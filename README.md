# Text-Summarizer
Text-Summarizer using Python,NLP
A text summarizer is a computer-based tool that aims to condense and present the main points or key information from a given piece of text. Its purpose is to save time and effort for readers by providing a concise summary of longer texts, such as articles, documents, or essays, while capturing the most important ideas and concepts.

Text summarizers use various techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, to analyze the content and structure of the text. They often employ strategies like extracting key sentences, identifying important keywords, or generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text. Some text summarizers may also consider the frequency or relevance of specific terms to determine their significance.

There are two main types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting and merging the most important sentences or phrases directly from the original text. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that convey the main ideas in a more condensed form, often requiring a deeper understanding of the text.
